# K-nearest neighbour 

   K-nearest neighbour is one of the Classification models in Machine Learning. I have used a Euclidean distance to calculate the closeness between two data points. Here the Iris Dataset contain four coordinates.
   
   The above code has been explained in the medium article. You can read the article [here](https://saravananannamalai4871.medium.com/k-means-neighbour-from-scratch-in-python-11c9ffc0e834).
   

# Heart-attack-analysis
         
         This Notebook contains a Exploratory Data Analysis of a Heart-attack dataset which contains 13 independent variables and one dependent variable. The different plots were plotted between different variables. Models such as LogisticRegression and KNeighborClassfier were fitted on to the dataset and model accuracy was calculated.
